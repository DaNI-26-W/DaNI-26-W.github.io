I am Daniel Kadoke, a biostatistician with a strong passion for data-driven research and evidence-based decision making. I work extensively with R and Stata to analyze, model, and interpret complex health and biological data. I am highly hardworking, detail-oriented, and committed to delivering accurate, reliable, and impactful results. I enjoy turning data into clear insights that support research, policy, and real-world solutions.
